This folder is used to test and analyze the capabilities of [WASMixer](github.com/security-pride/WASMixer).

## Structure

- **`wasm_mixer_combinations.py`**  
  Script that tries all obfuscation possibilities over `base.wasm`, generating output files in the `composed/` directory.

- **`composed/`**  
  Contains all generated combinations and utility scripts:
  
  - **`wasm_to_txt.sh`**  
    Converts WASM binaries into their decimal representation. (uses [binex.py](https://github.com/Owanesh/wasmlabs/tree/main/malware_analysis/crypto_javascript/binex)).
    
  - **`wasm_to_wat.sh`**  
    Converts WASM binaries into `.wat` (WebAssembly Text) format. (uses [wasm2wat](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/tree/main))
   

- **`inject_decimal_into_javascript.py`**  
  For each `.txt` file in `composed/txt_dec/`, this script:
  - Copies `base_placeholder.js` to `js/<txt_filename>.js`
  - Replaces the label `WASMIXER_DECIMAL_REPRESENTATION_OF_BINARY` in the copy with the content of the `.txt` file.
