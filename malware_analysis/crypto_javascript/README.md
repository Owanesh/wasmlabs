## Crypto JavaScript Analysis

This folder contains resources for inspecting the operation of browser‑based cryptominers. Even though well‑known services like Coinhive were shut down in 2019, the techniques remain relevant for research and detection.

### Contents
- `cryptomock_server/`: Minimal mock backend that emulates a pool/server used by cryptominers for testing and analysis.
- `keyword_finder.py`: Utility to recursively scan files in a folder and report occurrences of given keywords (skips `.json` files).

### Quick start
Run the keyword finder against a dataset directory, searching for comma‑separated terms:

```bash
python3 keyword_finder.py --find miner,wasm --base <your_samples_folder>
```

### Notes
- The mock server is for local analysis only; do not expose it publicly.
- Results from `keyword_finder.py` include a summary and per‑folder details to help triage suspicious samples.
