# Crypto JavaScript Analysis Suite

This repository provides a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing, simulating, and researching browser-based cryptomining and JavaScript/WebAssembly malware. It includes mock servers, static and dynamic analysis tools, sample downloaders, and utilities for binary/text conversion and runtime tracing.

## Folder Overview

### `cryptojacking/`
- **cryptomock_server/**  
	A full-featured mock server that simulates cryptojacker endpoints and protocols (HTTPS and WebSocket). Useful for dynamic analysis and safe malware testing.  
	- *Features*: Simulates mining pool, supports CORS, logs all activity, auto-generates SSL certs.
	- *Run*: `python server.py` (see internal README for endpoints and troubleshooting).

- **library/**  
	Contains JavaScript and WebAssembly resources for cryptomining analysis.
	- **wasmixer/**  
		Tools and scripts for generating, obfuscating, and analyzing WASM binaries using [WASMixer](https://github.com/security-pride/WASMixer).
		- *scripts/*: Python helpers for batch obfuscation, opcode analysis, JS/HTML injection, and performance experiments.  
			- See `scripts/README.md` for workflow and usage examples.


### `SoK/`
- **keyword_finder.py**  
	Recursively scans files for suspicious keywords (skipping `.json`), useful for triage and detection.
- **downloader/**  
	Contains `sok_downloader.py`, a script to automatically download JavaScript samples from MalwareBazaar using hashes from `VT_miners.csv`.
	- *Usage*: Requires API key in `.env`, see `downloader/README.md` for details.

### `tools/`
- **binex/**  
	Utility to convert between binary files (e.g., `.wasm`) and text (decimal/hex) representations.
	- *Usage*:  
		- Text to binary: `python binex.py input.txt output.wasm`
		- Binary to text: `python binex.py input.wasm output.txt`
	- See `binex/README.md` for more examples.

- **wasmlens/**  
	Bun-based tracing harness for deep runtime analysis of WebAssembly, blobs, workers, and network activity in Chromium.
	- *Features*: Records Chrome DevTools traces, saves all `.wasm` and blob resources, outputs detailed reports.
	- *Usage*:  
		- Install dependencies: `bun install`
		- Run: `bun run index.ts --url <file_or_url> --deep`
	- See `wasmlens/README.md` for options and output structure.
