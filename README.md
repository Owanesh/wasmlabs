# WASM Labs

This repository contains experiments and prototypes around WebAssembly (WASM). It serves as a sandbox to explore performance characteristics, tooling, and security/malware manipulation in the context of WASM.

## Structure

This repository is organized into several main folders, each serving a distinct purpose:

- **benchmark_wasi/**  
  Contains experiments and tools for benchmarking WebAssembly (WASM) workloads. Includes adaptations of classic UnixBench tests, scripts for running and collecting results, and patches for WASI compatibility.

- **malware_analysis/**  
  Focuses on the analysis and manipulation of WebAssembly-based malware. Contains scripts for static and dynamic analysis, cryptojacking research, and utilities for inspecting and transforming WASM and JavaScript samples.

Each folder contains its own README or documentation with more details about its contents and usage.
